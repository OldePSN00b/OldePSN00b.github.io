  So this is the obligatory first post on my blog. I've never blogged before so bear
with me. I also have never used Git for much of anything and I heard about Github
Pages essentially being a Do-It-Yourself blog, essentially free. Sure there are easier
ways to do this but it doesn't put the check in the nerd box, so here we are. I'm 
learning Git, Github Pages, Jekyll, Markdown from Github's document pages, Google and just
pure determination. I haven't asked ChatGPT anything yet about it but it's just a matter 
of time.
