  So this is the obligatory first post on my blog. I've never blogged before so bear with me. 
I also have never used Git for much of anything and I heard about Github Pages essentially 
being a Do-It-Yourself blog, essentially free. Sure there are easier ways to do this but it 
doesn't put the check in the nerd box, so here we are. I'm learning Git, Github Pages, Jekyll, 
Markdown from Github's document pages, Google and just pure determination. I haven't asked ChatGPT anything yet about it but it's just a matter of time. So what should you expect here? This is the blog of an old IT guy and will probably be full ofrandom things at the beginning, until I figure out what I want to do with it. If you're looking for handpicked, curated content you'll probably be waiting awhile. 

  As a professed old IT guy, I started out like most old IT guys, managing windows devices with VBS, batch files and all sorts of other methods to attempt to streamline processes in my environment. I'm a stubbord old sod and I figured well, if it works, why change it? Many, many years ago we took over a department that was managed by an IT contractor to bring things into a more cohesive fold. We spent a few weeks switching domains and learning their hardware and software requirements. While I was migrating an old server, I discovered some software that the contractor used by a company called Admin Arsenal (now pdq.com). This software just about changed everything for me for my current job as it allowed me to "deploy" software. Prior to the discovery, we were running around or remoting in to computers and installing software manually. When i realized what this software did after researching it, I approached my boss and pretty much explained that this software would change everything for how we did software installs. I was allowed to purchase it a few weeks later and we have been using Deploy and Inventory since. Because of that discovery, I wanted to further streamline things and heard about PC imaging (we were installing Windows off optical media on computers that needed to be wiped) and we implemented Fog (www.fogproject.org) and I started building OS images and we would save even more time!
